# OSXWebViewCache

OSXWebViewCache is a framework written in Objective-C which enables caching of (static) URL resources requested by an OSX webview (suitable when building hybrid applications).

It expands upon the concepts and code in [this](https://www.raywenderlich.com/59982/nsurlprotocol-tutorial) article.  

### Features

* Caches URL resources on a per-domain basis.

* Updates cached resources only when they are modified (using the "Last-Modified" HTTP header).

* Serves cached resources when internet connectivity is unavailable.

### Usage

1. The project contains two targets, the OSXWebViewCache framework and a sample application ('Driver'). After building the project, drag and drop the OSXWebViewCache framework into your own project to use it. 

2. Use the framework as follows:

	```objective-c
	#import <OSXWebViewCache/CachedURLProtocol.h>

	// ...

	// register the domain 'example.com' to cache static resources for it and all its subdomains.
	[CachedURLProtocol setDomains:@[@"http://example.com"]];

	// register the CachedURLProtocol class (subclass of NSURLProtocol) to handle requests for the registered domain.
    [NSURLProtocol registerClass:[CachedURLProtocol class]];
    ```

The cache utilizes Core Data and the database is stored in the directory ~/Library/[your application's bundle identifier].

Also see the Driver sample application for more details.
